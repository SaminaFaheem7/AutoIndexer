# AutoIndexer
Introduction:- 
      Professor Jackson was just assigned to be the editor of a riveting textbook titled “Advanced Data Structure Implementation and Analysis”. She is super excited about the possibility of delving into the material and checking it for technical correctness. However, one of the more mundane tasks she must perform is creating an index for the book.  Everyone has used the index at the back of a book before.  An index organizes important words or phrases in alphabetical order together with a list of pages on which they can be found.  But, who or what creates these indexes? Do humans create them? Do computers create them? As a comp sci prof, Jackson decides she wants to automate the process as much as possible because she knows that an automated indexer is faster and more accurate, and because it can be reused later when she finishes writing her own book.  So as she is editing the book, she keeps a list of words on each page that should be included in the index.  However, time is short, and she needs to get the book edited AND indexed quickly.  She’s enlisted your help to write an AutoIndexer.
